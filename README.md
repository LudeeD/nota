# NOTA

NOTA is a simple note taker tool that helps you organize your notes.

# Why Another tool ? Aren't there enough already ?

Yeah, there are and that is part of the problem NOTA aims to fix.
I wanted to write my notes like I like to write my code: with no predefined 
editor, only tooling around the language.
I wanted to be this way for my notes too, I wanted to be able to edit and take
notes with any editor I wanted. No app lock in's no enforced programs or shaddy
web apps to use to do the things I wanted.

Simple text files, with a litle bit of tooling around for the extra producivity

# Install
