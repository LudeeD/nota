# NOTA Docs

NOTA is a simple note taker tool that helps you organize your notes.

## Why Another tool ? Aren't there enough already ?

Yeah, there are and that is part of the problem NOTA aims to fix.
I would like to write my notes like I like to write my code: with no predefined 
editor, only tooling around the language.
No app lock in's, no enforced programs or shaddy web apps to use to do the things I wanted.

Simple text files, with a litle bit of tooling around for the extra producivity

**Very early state in the project, not ready in any way shape or form xD**
